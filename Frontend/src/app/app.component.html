<h1>Real-Time Example in Angular using ASP.NET SignalR</h1>
<p>Real-time connection will only last 60 seconds before closing in the server side (if closed, just refresh the page). Real-time will iterate through USA and India</p>

<h4>Technical Informationish</h4>
<p>The repo will not guide you to how to incorporate it in your project but should give you an idea how to do it. Basically, it will be the most "updated" project that uses SignalR with Angular. As for as I know, none of the documents/articles online at the moment uses the latest .NET 6. They also don't use the latest npm package necessary for the signalR to work with Angular</p>
<p>As for frontend techs I used Chart.js to plot/animate everything you see here</p>
<p>How did I get here without getting the most updated docs in the world? By checking the documents for each tech I used since that will the freshest information you can get and seeing the difference from that information to the old information found online</p>
